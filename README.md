e-shopping-center-app
An app(+website)  for all small businesses that either don't have websites or their website isn't well known(market sellers,small business etc)where they can each have an “online store” .
People can search for sellers by department and then see the different “stores”.
Any seller who wants to open an online store will be able to choose his categories ,upload pictures of his products..have a dashboard ..and it will all work just like a regular website.
They can also post jobs and anyone who creates a job alert on will get notified when there's a match.
